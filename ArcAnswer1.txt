Subject:Thank you for the tour
==========================================
Dear Mr.Brown:

It was a pleasure meeting you last week. Thank you also for the excellent tour of your assembly plant. I came away from my visit even more impressed with your organization, and I'm confident it will lead to increased business between us.

I've discussed my visit with some of our technical people and I will send you some follow-up questions shortly.

Thank you again for your time and interest.

Best regards,

Hanako Suginami
